# Ensemble Reinforcement Learning Project

The objective of this project is to exeperiment ensemble methods applied to reinforcement learning. Specifically using a method of incorporating plans or trajectories among agents.

The environment and agent is initialized and trained in main.py, the setting for the run are set in the config folder. Most utils and training code is in src.
